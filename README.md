<p>Welcome to the Women's Cross Country page!!</p>
<p>We are a team made up of many great athletes, all with unique amount of talent. This year our team has many young runners that will help bring new 
energy to the team. Though we have a strong young base, we still got a fierce upperclassman group. With the freshman introducing the upperclassman to 
the newer characteristics, the veterans are making sure to show the youngins the loops of college life and balancing both athletics and schoolwork.</p>

<p>Together we are strong! We support and lookout for one another, keeping each others heads up. Our goal as a team is to improve our standing 
against other teams, but to also work harder together as one. Everyone can have their own individual goals, but in the end the overall goal 
is to do it for the team.</p>
